Concrete as Energy Storage: Researchers at MIT have developed a supercapacitor made from concrete that can store energy, potentially transforming building materials into power sources.Supercapacitor Advantages: Unlike batteries, supercapacitors can charge quickly and withstand more charge cycles. The carbon-cement supercapacitor is efficient but releases energy rapidly, which is currently less suitable for long-term power supply.Potential Applications: The technology could lead to roads that charge electric cars or buildings with energy-storing walls and foundations, providing a clean energy solution for the future.Environmental Considerations: While reducing reliance on lithium batteries, the production of this new type of concrete still has an environmental impact, as cement production is a significant source of CO2 emissions.
