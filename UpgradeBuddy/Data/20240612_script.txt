Elon Musk is right about hiding 'likes' on Twitter/X. You've gotta hand it to him 😲👍 
Now, your likes stay private 🎉🔒 
No more fear of attack 💪😌 
Public likes can be embarrassing 😳😅 
Especially with adult content 🚫🙈 
Musk says it’s for free speech 🗣️🗽 
But really, it's about avoiding shame 🤫😌 
Enjoy your freedom to like 😎❤️
